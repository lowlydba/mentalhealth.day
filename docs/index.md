### What is a mental health day?

Taking a day off of work or school to focus on your emotional wellness. It’s similar to a traditional sick day, except that you don’t need to have a physical illness or injury to use it.

Some common reasons people take mental health days are:

- feeling burnt out from day-to-day job responsibilities
- dealing with personal mental health issues
- working through grief
- experiencing an imbalance between work and home

### What is this site for?

Use mentalhealth.day as a status in your workplace's chat apps ("I'm taking a [mentalhealth.day](https://mentalhealth.day)"), as your out of office auto-reply email, or on social media to indicate you're taking a break. Spreading awareness and normalizing self-care are important ways to destigmatize mental health.

To personalize who the day is for, add your name or handle via `?for=` when linking to the site: [mentalhealth.day?for=John%20Doe](https://mentalhealth.day?for=John%20Doe)

### What should I do on a mental health day?

- **Get outside** - A [Stanford][stanford] study showed that those who live in dense cities are 20% more likely to experience anxiety disorders than individuals who live in more rural, or “green”, areas. So take a walk or sit on a park bench and enjoy the world around you.
- **Rest** - If you’re feeling sleep deprived, or dealing with a particularly bad stint of anxiety or depression, you may just need to rest. Sleep until you naturally wake up, ask your partner to get the kids up that morning, or plan a nap during the day. Take the time to truly do nothing but rest your body.
- **Active rest** - You don’t need to be an expert to reap the benefits of mediation, which makes it a great practice for relaxation and disconnecting. It could be as simple as setting aside time to do some deep breathing in a quiet room, or you could use a guided meditation.
- **Set goals and priorities** - Decide what must get done now and what can wait. Learn to say “no” to new tasks if you start to feel like you’re taking on too much. Try to be mindful of what you have accomplished at the end of the day, not what you have been unable to do.
- **Practice gratitude** - Remind yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Be specific. Write them down at night, or replay them in your mind.
- **Focus on positivity** - Identify and challenge your negative and unhelpful thoughts.
