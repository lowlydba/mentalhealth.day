## What is a mental health day?

A mental health day can consist of taking a day off work or school to focus on emotional wellness. It’s similar to a sick day, except that you don’t need to have a physical ailment to use it. Many people — including those whose brains work in unique ways — find that stepping back can help manage everyday pressures such as sensory overload or the exhaustion of meeting life's demands.

Some common reasons people take mental health days are:

- feeling burnt out from day-to-day job responsibilities
- dealing with personal mental health issues
- working through grief
- experiencing an imbalance between work and home

## What is this site for?

Use mentalhealth.day as a status in your workplace's chat apps ("I'm taking a [mentalhealth.day](https://mentalhealth.day)"), as your out of office auto-reply email, or on social media to indicate you're taking a break. Spreading awareness and normalizing self-care are important ways to destigmatize mental health and recognize that mental wellness looks different for everyone.

To personalize who the day is for, add your name or handle to the URL:

<div id="input">
<span>
    <input id="name_input" style="padding: 3px;" type="text" size=50 placeholder="Enter your name">
    <button class="btn" data-clipboard-target="#url_preview">
        <img src="assets/img/clippy.svg" width=13 alt="Copy to clipboard">
    </button>
</span>
<br>
<span id="url_preview">https://mentalhealth.day?for=</span>

<script>
    document.getElementById('name_input').addEventListener('input', function() {
        var name = document.getElementById('name_input').value;
        var encodedName = encodeURIComponent(name);
        var url = "https://mentalhealth.day?for=" + encodedName;
        document.getElementById('url_preview').textContent = url;
    });
</script>
</div>
<br/>

## What should I do on a mental health day?

- **Get outside** - Being outside and in nature has been proven to improve mood and reduce stress levels. Activities like [forest bathing][forest-bathing] can lead to a wide range of both physical and mental benefits.
- **Rest** - If you’re feeling consistently tired, or are dealing with anxiety/depression, you may need more rest than you're getting. Try sleeping until you naturally wake up, asking your partner to get the kids up that morning, or prioritizing time for an afternoon nap during the day.
- **Active rest** - Explore relaxation or wellness programs or apps, which may incorporate meditation, muscle relaxation, or breathing exercises. Schedule regular times for these and other healthy activities you enjoy such as journaling.
- **Set goals and priorities** - Decide what must get done now and what can wait. Learn to say “no” to new tasks if you start to feel like you’re taking on too much. Try to be mindful of what you have accomplished at the end of the day, not what you have been unable to do.
- **Practice gratitude** - Remind yourself daily of things you are grateful for. Be specific. Write them down at night, or replay them in your mind.
- **Focus on positivity** - Identify and challenge your negative and unhelpful thoughts.
- **Stay connected** - Reach out to your friends or family members who can provide emotional support and practical help.
